## 1 Marketing Website

Create a marketing website landing page and
for a technology product.

### Brief

The marketing team for the company you work for just
launched a new product. They need a detailed marketing plan
that includes a website and landing page dedicated to driving
people to learn about the product and ultimately purchase it.

### Level 1

Having a website is a great way to showcase a product with the
ability to provide as many details as possible.

Create a new website that highlights the great features of the
product and provides in-depth information about each
feature. The pages should include:

• Homepage with photograph and high level overview

• Feature pages linked from homepage with more details

### Level 2

Just because you made a website, doesn’t automatically mean
people will purchase the product.

Create a landing page as part of the marketing website that
drives people to sign up with a form for more information.

### Level 3

Ultimately people need to purchase or sign up for the product
and to do that, they need a way to contact the sales team.

Create a new page with a form that will allow people to
contact the company if interested in the product. Include a
“Call to Action” link at the bottom of every page on the website
except for the contact page itself that links to the contact page.
